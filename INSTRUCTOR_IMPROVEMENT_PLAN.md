- ✅ **Live Sessions API**: Created `/api/instructor/live-sessions/route.ts`
- ✅ **Assessment Submissions API**: Created `/api/instructor/assessments/submissions/route.ts`

### **⚠️ POTENTIAL ISSUES TO MONITOR**

#### **1. Database Schema Dependencies**

- **Issue**: Some API endpoints depend on database tables that may not exist
- **Risk**: API calls may fail if tables are missing
- **Solution**: Verify Prisma schema includes all required tables

#### **2. Error Handling**

- **Issue**: Some components may not handle API failures gracefully
- **Risk**: Poor user experience on errors
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive error handling

#### **3. Performance**

- **Issue**: Some database queries may be inefficient
- **Risk**: Slow loading times
- **Solution**: Add database indexes and query optimization

---

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED**

### **Priority 1: Database Verification**

```bash
# Check if all required tables exist
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### **Priority 2: Error Handling Enhancement**

- Add try-catch blocks in all components
- Implement error boundaries
- Add user-friendly error messages

### **Priority 3: Performance Optimization**

- Add database indexes
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize API response times
