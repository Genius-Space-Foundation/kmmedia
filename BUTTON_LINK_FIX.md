# Button & Link Navigation Fix

## Issue Description

The "View Course Detail" and "Apply" buttons on the home page were not functioning properly due to incorrect HTML structure where Link components were wrapping Button components, creating invalid nested anchor-button elements.

## Root Cause

The issue was caused by improper nesting of Next.js `Link` and UI `Button` components:

```tsx
// ❌ INCORRECT - Invalid HTML (anchor wrapping button)
<Link href="/courses/123">
  <Button>View Details</Button>
</Link>
```

This creates:

```html
<a href="/courses/123">
  <button>View Details</button>
</a>
```

Which is invalid HTML and can cause:

- Navigation issues
- Accessibility problems
- Inconsistent behavior across browsers
- Failed link clicks

## Solution

Used the Button's `asChild` prop from Radix UI, which allows the Link to properly replace the button element:

```tsx
// ✅ CORRECT - Valid HTML (proper composition)
<Button asChild>
  <Link href="/courses/123">View Details</Link>
</Button>
```

This renders as:

```html
<a href="/courses/123" class="button-styles...">View Details</a>
```

## Files Fixed

### 1. Home Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)

Fixed all button navigation instances:

- Navigation menu buttons (About, Courses, Stories, Contact)
- Auth buttons (Sign In, Sign Up) - desktop and mobile
- Hero CTA buttons
- Course card buttons (View Details, Apply Now)
- "View All Courses" button
- "Start Your Journey" button

### 2. Course Detail Page (`src/app/courses/[id]/page.tsx`)

Fixed all button navigation instances:

- Header navigation buttons
- Auth buttons
- Mobile menu buttons
- Apply Now button (main CTA)
- Login to Apply button
- Browse Courses and Back to Home buttons
- Contact Admissions button

## Benefits

✅ Proper HTML semantics
✅ Better accessibility
✅ Improved SEO
✅ Consistent navigation behavior
✅ No more nested interactive elements
✅ Proper keyboard navigation
✅ Better screen reader support

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Click on "View Details" for any course - should navigate to course detail page
3. Click on "Apply Now" for any course - should navigate to application page (with auth check)
4. Test all navigation buttons in header and footer
5. Test mobile menu navigation
6. Verify keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter) works correctly

## Technical Details

The `asChild` prop is from Radix UI's Slot component, which allows:

- Merging props from the Button onto the child Link
- Preserving Button styling on the Link element
- Maintaining proper event handling
- Creating semantic HTML structure

This pattern is recommended by both Next.js and Radix UI documentation for composing interactive elements with navigation.
