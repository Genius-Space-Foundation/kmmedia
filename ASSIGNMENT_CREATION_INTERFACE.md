- `onEdit?: () => void` - Edit handler

### 4. AssignmentStatusManager (`/src/components/assignments/AssignmentStatusManager.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Manage multiple assignments with status tracking

**Features**:

- Assignment list with status badges (Draft, Active, Past Due)
- Submission and grading progress tracking
- Quick actions (Edit, Preview, Publish, Delete)
- Publishing workflow with confirmation
- Delete confirmation for assignments without submissions

- `onPublish: (id) => Promise<void>` - Publish handler
- `onDelete: (id) => Promise<void>` - Delete handler

## Form Validation Schema

The assignment creation form uses a comprehensive Zod validation schema that enforces:

- **Title**: 1-200 characters, required
- **Description**: 10-5000 characters, required
- **Instructions**: Optional, max 10000 characters
- **Due Date**: Must be in the future
- **File Settings**:
  - Max file size: 1MB - 500MB
  - Max files: 1-10 files
  - At least one allowed format required
- **Points**: 1-1000 points
- **Late Penalty**: 0-100% when late submissions enabled

## File Upload System

### Supported Formats

- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF
- **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI

### Security Features

- File type validation
- File size limits
- Virus scanning integration ready
- Secure file storage with Cloudinary

### Preview Capabilities

- Image preview in modal
- PDF preview with iframe
- File download for all types
- File metadata display

## Usage Examples

### Basic Assignment Creation

```tsx
import { AssignmentCreator } from "@/components/assignments";

function CreateAssignmentPage() {
  const handleSave = async (data) => {
    // Save assignment as draft
    await assignmentService.create(data);
  };

  const handlePublish = async (data) => {
    // Save and publish assignment
    await assignmentService.createAndPublish(data);
  };

  return (
    <AssignmentCreator
      courseId="course-123"
      onSave={handleSave}
      onPublish={handlePublish}
    />
  );
}
```

### Assignment Management

```tsx
import { AssignmentStatusManager } from "@/components/assignments";

function ManageAssignmentsPage() {
  const [assignments, setAssignments] = useState([]);

  const handlePublish = async (id) => {
    await assignmentService.publish(id);
    // Refresh assignments list
  };

  return (
    <AssignmentStatusManager
      assignments={assignments}
      onPublish={handlePublish}
      onEdit={(assignment) => router.push(`/assignments/${assignment.id}/edit`)}
      onViewSubmissions={(assignment) =>
        router.push(`/assignments/${assignment.id}/submissions`)
      }
    />
  );
}
```

## Integration with Backend Services

The components are designed to work with the existing `AssignmentService`:

```typescript
// Create assignment
const assignmentData = await AssignmentService.createAssignment(
  data,
  instructorId
);

// Publish assignment
const publishedAssignment = await AssignmentService.publishAssignment(
  assignmentId,
  instructorId
);

// Update assignment
const updatedAssignment = await AssignmentService.updateAssignment(
  assignmentId,
  data,
  instructorId
);
```

## Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Labels**: All form controls have proper labels
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with proper ARIA roles
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators

## Responsive Design

- **Mobile-First**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Breakpoint Support**: Responsive grid layouts
- **Touch-Friendly**: Large touch targets for mobile
- **Adaptive UI**: Components adapt to screen size

## Demo Pages

Two demo pages are included to showcase the functionality:

1. **Create Assignment** (`/assignments/create`): Full assignment creation workflow
2. **Manage Assignments** (`/assignments/manage`): Assignment status management

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests

- Form validation logic
- File upload functionality
- Component rendering with different props
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests

- Complete assignment creation workflow
- File upload and preview functionality
- Publishing workflow
- Assignment status management

### E2E Tests

- Full instructor workflow from creation to publishing
- File attachment and preview functionality
- Assignment editing and updating
- Multi-assignment management

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components can be lazy-loaded
- **File Upload**: Chunked upload for large files
- **Form Optimization**: Debounced validation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of file URLs

## Future Enhancements

1. **Rich Text Editor**: Integration with TipTap or similar
2. **Rubric Support**: Detailed grading criteria
3. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk publish/delete assignments
4. **Templates**: Assignment templates for common types
5. **Analytics**: Assignment performance metrics
6. **Collaboration**: Multi-instructor assignment creation

## Dependencies

- React 19.1.0
- React Hook Form 7.63.0
- Zod 4.1.11
- Radix UI components
- Lucide React icons
- Date-fns for date formatting
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## File Structure

```
